# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

## About Me
 My journey as a web developer started with a simple curiosity and has evolved into a deep passion. I enjoy crafting beautiful and functional websites that provide delightful user experiences.

## Skills

- **Web Development**: I have experience working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build responsive and interactive web applications. I'm also proficient in modern frameworks and libraries such as React and Vue.js.

- **Backend Development**: I have knowledge of server-side programming and working with databases. I'm comfortable with technologies like Node.js and Express.

- **Languages**: Apart from programming languages, I'm also interested in human languages. I believe that language is a powerful tool that helps us connect and understand each other better. I'm constantly learning new languages and exploring different cultures.

## Projects

Here are a few highlights of my recent projects:

- Rescue-me-demo: A interactive website built with React and Node.js. It showcases my skills in frontend development and UI/UX design. This project is part of my course at the DCI and was built in a team.

- my-todo-app: A responsive to do app with all the features buit from scratch with Ract. This project is part of my course at the DCI and was built in a team.
